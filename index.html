    <!-- <h3>Overview</h3> -->
      <p>Nedda and I have used this site to put together recommendations from last year's London students as well as tips from our own time in London. Feel free to ask us about anything – we both love trip planning and giving travel tips. </p>
      <p>Remember that most people going on this trip don’t know more than one or two other students, if any at all! If you have something planned, post it on Facebook or GroupMe so that other people who are interested can come along. If you want to plan travel in advance but don’t have anyone to go with, I guarantee that others feel the same way. Every year students who book weekend trips in advance (often with people they don’t know at all) have the best experience because they made the most of their time abroad. </p>
      <p>Lastly, tell us if you discover something wonderful in London that I should add to this list for future students!

  <div class="section" id = "afternoons" hidden>
    <!-- <h3>Afternoons</h3> -->
      <p>Use your afternoons for the typical touristy activities like lunch at a market followed by a museum or classic London sight.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Museums in London </strong>are almost all free. My favorites are the Tate Modern for modern art, the National Gallery for heavyweights like Monet, Turner, and da Vinci, and the British Museum for artifacts (they have the Rosetta Stone and an extensive Egypt exhibit). If you like fashion, make sure to check out the Victoria and Albert Museum. For a peek inside a beauitful London home, Sir John Soan's Museum is the carefully preserved home of an architect and art collector and very close to your dorms. </li>
        <li><strong>The Sky Garden</strong> is a fantastic observatory on top of one of London’s tallest buildings. You will need to book in advance, but you can usually wait until a couple of days beforehand so that you know the weather will be clear.</li>
        <!-- <li>Buckingham Palace tour: Buckingham Palace is only open for a few weeks each summer, and it usually falls while we are there. Tickets are a little pricey (maybe $25), but the rooms are incredible. If you go to Windsor and do the castle tour there (see below), you can probably skip this one.</li> -->
        <li>Take a cruise down the Thames to <strong>Greenwich</strong> and check out the Old Royal Naval College, which you'll recognize from movies and TV shows like Skyfall and the Crown. Grab lunch at Greenwich Market and stand with a foot in each hemisphere at the Meridian Line.</li>
        <li><strong>Kew Gardens</strong> is about 50 minutes way, but right by a tube station. The gardens are huge; you could spend hours walking around the grounds. The Victorian greenhouses are the highlight.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Harry Potter studio tour</strong> is a trek outside of London, so make sure to set aside at least 4-5 hours for this one. You will probably spend well over an hour getting there and minimum two hours exploring, but most students say it's worth the trip. Book tickets in advance: tickets are timed. </li>
        <li> Visit <strong>Windsor</strong>, the site of Harry and Megan’s wedding! For $15, you can get a return ticket from London to Windsor. The train takes about 35 minutes each way.  There’s not a ton there aside from the castle, which is huge (more of a town inside castle walls) and beautifully manicured.</li>
        <li><strong>Other various sights</strong> include Westminster Abbey, Tower Bridge and Hay’s Galleria, Fortnum and Mason and Harrods, exploring Notting Hill/ Portobello Road, the changing of the guard, Shakespeare’s Globe...</li>
      </ul>

  <div class="section" id = "weekends" hidden>
    <!-- <h3>Weekends </h3> -->
      <p>You’ll have three full weekends during the trip, not counting the one you arrive. I recommend staying in London at least one weekend and traveling one or two of the other weekends. On the weekend you stay in London, consider attending a Premier League soccer game or a horse race, having Sunday Roast and pints at a pub, or strolling the Columbia Road Flower Market on Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>If you go out of town, you will want to plan in advance. At a minimum, book trains/flights and accommodations. One piece of feedback we got from students last year is that they wished they'd booked trips sooner because once they got to the UK, booking everything they wanted to do was expensive.</p>
      <ul>
      <li id="Paris">You can take the Eurostar to <strong>Paris</strong> in just 2 hours and 20 minutes! Book the Eurostar as far in advance as possible (read: right now) as they have a tiered pricing scheme that gets very expensive in the summer if you book last minute. Make sure to ask Nedda for tips before you go. Fun accounting fact: the boat in our final review worksheet, Winged Victory, is named after a statue at the Louver.</li>
      <li id="Dublin">I have not actually been to <strong>Dublin</strong>, but our students last year loved it. Leta Beard (who goes to Ireland every year) recommends Trinity College, the Book of Kells, Gravity Bar at Guiness, and stay at the Barnacles Hostel.</li>
      <li id="Edinburgh">Take a beautiful train ride to the middle of <strong>Edinburgh</strong> (“Ed-in-burr-ah”) from the heart of London. Train tickets are cheap in advance and creep up to about $100 round trip if you book last minute. Don’t miss Tom Riddle’s grave, Elephant house (the café where JK Rowling started Harry Potter), Arthur’s Seat, and the Royal Mile.</li>
      <li id="Amsterdam">You can also take the Eurostar to <strong>Amsterdam</strong> but again, book well in advance for good prices. Be warned that Amsterdam is very expensive, but worth it for Anne Frank’s House (book ahead), the Van Gogh Museum, and iconic architecture.</li>
       <li id="Bath">Take the train from London to <strong>Bath</strong>, which is known for its Roman-built baths and a source of inspiration for Jane Austen.  You can also stop at Stonehenge on the way back to London!</li>

  <div class="section" id = "evenings" hidden>
    <!-- <h3>Evenings</h3> -->
    <p>For the best recommendations on what to do in the evenings, grab a copy of Time Out magazine, which is free and handed out outside major tube stations on Tuesdays. Here are a few other ideas.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't miss London's <strong>theater scene</strong>. There are so many great comedy shows, plays, and musicals in London, and they are the same quality but generally lower in price than the same play in New York. For cheap day-of tickets, head to TKTS London, where classic older shows like Phantom of the Opera, Wicked, and Les Mis are usually available at discounted prices.
      </li>
      <ul id="plays">
      <li><strong>Hamilton</strong> in London is much, much cheaper than in the US. You can find tickets for $150 if you book last minute, and if you book in advance you will probably find tickets for $40 - $90!</li>
      <li><strong>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</strong> is a two-part play. The London location is also far cheaper than HP and the CC in New York. You’ll pay about $130 total for both parts, and you’ll go to the theater two nights in a row. Book months in advance.</li>
      <li>Any show at the <strong>Soho Theatre</strong>, which has multiple comedy shows per night at a variety of price levels. There's a lively bar downstairs for a drink before the show.</li>
      <li>Agatha Christie’s <strong>The Mousetrap</strong> is the longest running play in the world! It’s a murder mystery, tickets are very reasonable ($20ish) and my college-age brother recommends this along with the Lion King as one of his favorite activities in London.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>There’s at least one <strong>major museum open late</strong> until 9 or 10 each weeknight. This is the best time to go as there are almost no crowds. I absolutely loved the Tate Modern and the National Gallery at night as they are both in iconic buildings and can be busy during the day.</li>

      <li><strong>BBC Proms</strong> will be going on while we are there. The Proms are a classical music festival (different performers each night) and while I don’t know a ton about classical music, the venue – Royal Albert Hall – is worth the ticket price alone. There are very cheap tickets if you stand in the pit. This is one of the least touristy and most British activities out there.</li>

      <li>Pubs are like London’s living rooms. They aren’t just for drinking; they are social places to read the paper, eat a roast, or play a card game. London’s <strong>pub quiz</strong> nights are amazing! I recommend the quiz on Wednesdays at the Sekforde Arms right by your dorms, although the questions are difficult and you'll want to read up on British current events before going.</li>

      <li>London has fantastic night life. East London is known for its <strong>clubs and hipster bars </strong> (think foosball theme, speakeasies, or ironically American West style saloons). Taking the night bus or night tube back after a night out is one of my favorite London experiences, because normally reserved Londoners really lose their inhibitions at 2 am. The students like Ballie Ballerson (a ball pit bar...?) but I have not been. Have fun, stay safe, and keep track of each other!</li>

<!--       <h3>Meals</h3> -->
      <p>You can eat well in London on the cheap at market stalls or kebab huts. London also has several big "quick but healthy" chains like Pret a Manger, Itsu, and EAT.  PAUL and Gail's are both high quality bakery chains.If you are vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free, you will love London. All three are quite mainstream in the UK, and you’ll have no trouble finding great food to eat. Nedda and I are taking you to some of our favorite restaurants for group dinners, but here are a few other favorites if you want to eat out.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Borough, Camden, Broadway, Maltby Street, South Bank, and Old Spitalfields <strong>street markets </strong>all have great international cheap eats stalls.</li>
        <li>The Breakfast Club is an all-day breakfast sport with a messy 80’s diner theme. The wait can be very long on weekends, so go after class for brunch. </li>
        <li>Nando’s grilled chicken chain has a cult following - you may have been to the one in Portland. Once student liked this place so much that she went three days in a row. Google "cheeky Nando's" for cultural background via Twitter.</li>
        <li>For a <strong>splurge dinner</strong>, head to the Barbary, Palomar, Bocca di Lupo, or Ottolenghi. </li>
        <li>We have a group <strong>afternoon tea</strong> scheduled, but you may want to go to more. The Wolsey is a popular spot with a classic art-deco vibe. Book ahead.</li>
        <li>While you're in the UK, you'll also need to try a full English breakfast, Indian food, and fish and chips!</li>
   <!--      <li>For a nicer meal in the center of town, go to Shepherd's Market or Neil's Yard.</li> -->
