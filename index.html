    <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>London is my favorite city in the world: I have spent four months there in the last year and a half, and there are still tons of places I want to go and activities I want to do. Nedda has also been to London countless times. Nedda and I both LOVE giving travel recommendations, so feel free to ask us about anything ‚Äì in general, Nedda‚Äôs expertise includes shopping and eating in central London, while mine is more museums and hipster London neighborhoods on the edge of town. </p>
      <p>Remember that most people going on this trip don‚Äôt know more than one or two other students, if any at all! If you have something planned, post it on Facebook or GroupMe so that other people who are interested can come along. If you want to plan travel in advance but don‚Äôt have anyone to go with, I guarantee that others feel the same way. Every year students who book in advance (often with people they don‚Äôt know at all) have the best experience because they made the most of their time abroad. </p>
      <p>Lastly, tell us if you discover something wonderful in London that I should add to this list for future students!

  <div class="section" id = "afternoons">
    <h3>Afternoons</h3>
      <p>Use your afternoons (after homework!) for the typical touristy things like lunch at a market followed by a museum or classic London sight.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Borough, Camden, Broadway, and Old Spitalfields markets all have great cheap eats stalls.</li>
        <li>Museums in London are almost all FREE ‚Äì without even an awkward ask for donations. Recommended museums in order of how much I enjoyed them:</li>‚Ä¢
        o  UPDATE
        <li>Other various sights: Westminster Abbey, Tower Bridge and Hay‚Äôs Galleria, Fortnum and Mason and Harrods, exploring Notting Hill/ Portobello Road, the changing of the guard, Shakespeare‚Äôs Globe</li>
        <li>The Sky Garden: there‚Äôs a fantastic observatory (think trendy coffee shop/bar with Amazon Spheres-style plant vibe) on top of one of London‚Äôs tallest buildings. Students invariably post great instagrams from here. You will need to book in advance, but you can usually wait until a couple of days beforehand so that you know the weather will be clear.</li>
        <li>Buckingham Palace tour: Buckingham Palace is only open for a few weeks each summer, and it usually falls while we are there. Tickets are a little pricey (maybe $25), but the rooms are incredible. If you go to Windsor and do the castle tour there, you can probably skip this one.</li>
        <li>Afternoon trip to Greenwich: take a cruise down the Thames</li>
        <li>Afternoon trip to Kew Gardens:</li>
        <li> Afternoon trip to Windsor: The site of Harry and Megan‚Äôs wedding! For $15, you can get a return ticket from London to Windsor. The train takes about 35 minutes each way.  There‚Äôs not a ton there aside from the castle, which is HUGE (more of a town inside castle walls) and beautifully manicured. Admission is about $25, but when you see how big the castle is, you‚Äôll think this is a pretty good deal. When I went in winter 2019, Megan Markle‚Äôs wedding dress was on display and I ended up photographing a proposal (!! It‚Äôs definitely a big romance spot).</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

  <div class="section" id = "weekends">
    <h3>Weekends </h3>
      <p>You‚Äôll have three full weekends during the trip, not counting the one you arrive. I recommend staying in London at least one weekend, and traveling one or two of the other weekends
      Staying in London: Premier League soccer game, Horse Racing, Sunday Roast and pints at a pub, Columbia Road Flower Market (Sunday mornings), ADD MORE.</p>
      <p>Going out of town: You will want to plan these in advance. At a minimum, book trains/flights and accommodations. One piece of feedback we got from students last year is that they wished we‚Äôd told them about these sooner because once they got to the UK, booking everything they wanted to do was too expensive.</p>
      <ul>
      <li id="Paris">Paris ‚Äì You can take the Eurostar to Paris in just 2 hours and 20 minutes! Book the Eurostar as far in advance as possible ‚Äì like right now ‚Äì  as they have a tiered pricing scheme that gets very expensive in the summer if you book last minute. Nedda is far more knowledgeable about Paris than I am so make sure to pick her brain before you go. Fun accounting fact: the boat in our final review worksheet, Winged Victory, is named after my favorite statue ever at the Louver.</li>
      <li id="Dublin">Dublin ‚Äì I have not actually been, but our students last year loved it. Leta Beard (who goes to Ireland every year) recommends Trinity College, the Book of Kells, Gravity Bar at Guiness, and stay at the Barnacles Hostel.</li>
      <li id="Edinburgh">Edinburgh (‚ÄúEd-in-burr-ah‚Äù)  - Take a beautiful train ride (about 4 hours each way - lots of time to study accounting) from the heart of London to the middle of Edinburgh. Train tickets are cheap in advance and creep up to about $100 round trip if you book last minute. Don‚Äôt miss: Tom Riddle‚Äôs grave, Elephant house - the caf√© where JK Rowling started Harry Potter, Arthur‚Äôs Seat, and the Royal Mile.</li>
      <li id="Amsterdam">Amsterdam ‚Äì You can also take the Eurostar to Amsterdam (again, book well in advance for good prices). Be warned that Amsterdam is very expensive, but worth it for Anne Frank‚Äôs House (book ahead), the Van Gogh Museum, and iconic architecture.</li>
      </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id = "evenings">
    <h3>Evenings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Plays! There are so many great plays and musicals in London, and they are the same quality but generally lower in price than the same play in New York. For cheap day-of tickets, head to TKTS London (classic older shows like Phantom of the Opera, Wicked, and Les Mis are usually available). Below are my favorites.
      </li>
      <ul id="plays">
      <li>Hamilton: Hamilton in London is MUCH cheaper than in the US. You can find tickets for $150 if you book last minute and if you book in advance you will probably find tickets for $40 - $90!</li>
      <li>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child: Note that this is a two-part play. Also FAR cheaper than HP and the CC in New York. You‚Äôll pay about $130 total for both, and you‚Äôll go to the theater two nights in a row. Book months in advance.</li>
      <li>Agatha Christie‚Äôs The Mousetrap: this is the longest running play in the world! It‚Äôs a murder mystery, tickets are very reasonable ($20ish) and my college-age brother recommends this along with the Lion King as one of his favorite activities in London - and he‚Äôs not really a play guy, so that‚Äôs saying something!</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Museums open late: there‚Äôs at least one major museum open late (till 9 or 10) each weeknight. This is the best time to go as there are almost no crowds. I absolutely loved the Tate Modern and the National Gallery at night as they are both in iconic buildings and have great exhibits.</li>

      <li>The finer things: BBC Proms will be going on while we are there. The proms are basically a classical music festival (different performers each night) and while I don‚Äôt know a ton about classical music, the venue ‚Äì Royal Albert Hall ‚Äì is worth the ticket price alone. There are very cheap tickets if you stand in the pit. This is one of the least touristy and most British activities out there.</li>

      <li>Pubs: pubs are like London‚Äôs living rooms. They aren‚Äôt just for drinking; they are social places to read the paper, eat a roast, or play a card game. London‚Äôs pub quiz nights are amazing! Please invite me if you go to one.</li>

      <li>Going OUT out: I literally know nothing about this üòá, but London has a great bar scene. East London is known for its clubs and hipster bars (think foosball theme or ironically American West style saloons). Taking the night bus or night tube back after a night out is one of my favorite London experiences, because normally reserved Londoners really lose their inhibitions at 2 am. The students like Ballie Ballerson (ball pit bar??) but I have not been. Have fun, stay safe, and keep track of each other!</li>

    </ul>

    <div class="section" id = "meals">
      <h3>Meals</h3>
      <p>I am not a huge foodie, and I like to save money for other activities, so I eat at cheap market stalls or get falafel (Europeans love falafel and kebab huts). Pret a Manger and EAT are quick and tasty options if you just want a quick sandwich. They are both chains; you‚Äôll see them everywhere.  If you are vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free, you will love London. All three are quite mainstream in the UK, and you‚Äôll have no trouble finding great food to eat.</p>
      <p>Nedda and I are taking you to some of our favorite restaurants for group dinners (Drake and Morgan, Dishoom, Blueprint Caf√©), but here are a few other favorites if you want to eat out.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Breakfast Club: all-day breakfast with a sort of messy 80‚Äôs diner theme. The wait can be very long for brunch ‚Äì so go for lunch or dinner instead!</li>
        <li>Nando‚Äôs: grilled chicken chain with a cult following - you may have been to the one in Portland. Once student liked this place so much that she went three days in a row.</li>
        <li>Tea: we have a tea scheduled, but you may want to go to more.  Great options include the Wolsey (classic art-deco vibe) or UPDATE</li>
      </ul>
